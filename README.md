# BadCode
Code demos for the "How to write bad code using C#" session

There has been lots of talk on the importance of writing good and manageable code – code whose inherent beauty bring tears to the eyes of the developer that looks at it. 
This talk is not like that. This talk will focus on the techniques that are used by millions across the world to bring tears to the eyes of the maintaining developer, as well as a graphic stream of profanities.We will investigate some of the most common anti-patterns and half-measures that occur in real live code, and will marvel at the ingenuity and outright creativity necessary to create ugly messes of unmaintainable code that still manages to work for it’s users. 

(Most of the code examples are inspired by, or straight out stolen, from The Dayly WTF - a repository of bad code and antipatterns that should be a mandatory read for every software developer)
